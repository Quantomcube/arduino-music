System Requirements:

- MIDI Playback Software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
    MIDI File format

This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from LucasFilm Game's
"Monkey Island 2" adventure game.  It has been converted from the MT-32
version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Wave Table or better
sound card is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Recorded/converted for General MIDI by Tom Lewandowski.
