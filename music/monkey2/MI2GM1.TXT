System Requirements:

- MIDI Playback Software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
    MIDI File format
- General MIDI sound device  (Wave Table recommended.)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from LucasFilm Game's
"Monkey Island 2" adventure game.  It has been converted from the MT-32
version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Wave Table sound card
is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Recorded/Converted to Type 1 Standard MIDI File format by Tom Lewandowski.
