"Ghost Ship Theme" (c) Lucasarts Entertainment Company

arranged by Peter Silk

This is the msic you hear while invisible on Lechuck's ship.
I have tested it on the SB AWE32 and it sounds good, and 
the yamaha DBXG50 card and it sounds great.
Enjoy.
Note: this is in no way an original tune, so if you like the TUNE
don't go complimenting me. If you like the arrangement, THEN compliment 
me
